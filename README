# Dorothea

Dorothea is a concept project. It is a simple survey tool, including
* a map component. The app will have a geolocation control, and the user will be able to drag a marker on the map to make the location more precise.
* location services. Once the marker is dragged, location data is automatically fetched from another server. (in our case /wegendatabank)
* image upload. The user will be able to take a screenshot and upload it.
* mail. The user can send his survey to an email address.
* kml generation. The user can choose to generate a .kml and have it forwarded to his email address.
* Push to gis. The data can be pushed as JSON to an able mapping component for further analysis on desktop. (in our case /geoloket)
Its main purpose is to test overall performance of the data connection in the field, and the performance of the stock browser versus chrome.
